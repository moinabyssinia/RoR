### Structs
Only useful when creating a class with a few attributes 
When it gets crowded, use the conventional class

### files
"a+" appends - does not replace

### Marshal class
converts collections of Ruby objects into a byte stream - allowing them to be stored outside the currently active script
dump the Ruby object as a string and then load it later

`output = Marshal.dump(player)`
